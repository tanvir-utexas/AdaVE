We propose an adaptive motion-guided cross-frame attention mechanism for video synthesis that reduces redundant computations by focusing on moving regions and reuses key-values across frames, achieving smoother transitions, enhanced quality, and processing more frames within the same computational budget. This approach outperforms current methods in accuracy and temporal consistency.

Code will be released soon!
